# MachineLearning_basic
This is a 3-part project regarding the construction of neural networks.
These neural networks have been constructed from scratch without using secondary machine learning libraries (pytorch, tensorflow) for better understanding of the learning algorithms that are being deployed.

First part of the project is about solving classification problems.
Second part of the project is about constructing generative models.
Third part of the project is about the computation of conditional expectations based on a research paper by professor 

If you are not familiar with Greek, skip through the reports and try running the code yourself.
Note that part 3 is incomplete.
